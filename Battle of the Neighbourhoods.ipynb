    "    Jerusalem is an important and hub city for almost half of the world population. As a holy city for Christians, Muslims and Jews, it is a city that is often visited by many religious organizations, as well as people wanting to see a living and breathing bit of history. Israel, being a Jewish state, observes the laws of the Sabbath nationwide, meaning that no business or public transport are to operate for 25 hours between sundown Friday and sundown Saturday. Naturally, this poses a problem to the less religious folk who don't observe the Sabbath, whether they are locals or visiting. This is a problem nationwide but can be felt most in the holiest of holy cities. Many a times visitors find themselves staying in an area of the city, with a free evening but nothing around them to indulge in as everything is closed. My proposal is to examine Jerusalem's neighbourhoods, and group them by the amount of bars, nightlife, and what Foursquare labels as \"fun\" is in it. \n",
    "   \n",
    "    This can have several implications. If we see that a certain area is lacking in bars, it could potentially be a viable area to start a new business, depending on data regarding which neighbourhood it is in, specifically if it is religious or not. A religious neighbourhood would not allow the building of a facility that makes noise at night and whose main hours of operation are on the weeked, during the Sabbath. Conversely, we can examine areas where there is a large cluster of bars and see if it is viable to open food or taxi services, depending on the amount in the area.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Lastly, we will compare the nieghbourhoods of Jerusalem to those of Reykjavik, Iceland, for fun and see what we find. I expect Reykjavik to have a higher frequency of nightlife and bars than Jerusalem, despite it being such a remote geographical city."
